# Google-clone
A Google Homepage look alike 

It has most of the same features as the Google.com homepage. You can search as well as go to the Gmail login using the button. 

Wesbite is fully responsive and the hyperlinks on the button work as well. Font styles and spacing is not the exact same but quite similar. This was only made using Front-End languages.
